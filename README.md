A vanilla JavaScript challenge to tease your brain and sharpen your code.

This is a fun, interactive riddle game built purely with vanilla JavaScript â€” no frameworks, no libraries. It features three difficulty levels â€” Easy, Medium, and Hard â€” each with a limited number of tries to guess the correct answer. The riddles touch on topics from general knowledge, tech, Arabic culture, and Islamic values.

The goal behind this project was to challenge myself and practice core JavaScript skills while building something thatâ€™s not just engaging, but also meaningful.
